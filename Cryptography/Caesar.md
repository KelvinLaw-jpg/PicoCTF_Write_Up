## Solution

Opening the downloaded file, it shows `picoCTF{dspttjohuifsvcjdpoabrkttds}`

Since it is a caesar cipher, you just have to shit the charactor a few times.
The online decodeer I use is [https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher)
After shifting it 25 times to the right you will get the flag
