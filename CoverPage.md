# PicoCTF_Challenges_Write_Up

![picoCTF Logo](picoctf_logo.png)

Welcome to my [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) Journey.
This Repo is created to:

* Document for my Journey as a Hacker
* Provide a personal view on solving the challenges
* Be a concrete project to improve my skills in Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, github, etc.

It is organised by categories instead of year, since I like to treat them as a subject and focus on the subject 1 by 1 instead of the year they came out.

## Categories
- [Web Exploitation](picoCTF_2024/README.md)
- [Cryptography](picoCTF_2023/README.md)
- [Reverse Engineering](picoCTF_2022/README.md)
- [Forensics](Beginner_picoMini_2022/README.md)
- [General Skills](picoMini_by_redpwn/README.md)
- [Binary Exploitation](picoCTF_2021/README.md)
