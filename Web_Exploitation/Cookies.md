## Solution

As the challenge name indicates we should keep an eye out for [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) here.  
There probably are more ways to solve this challenge, but here are two solutions.

### Manual DevTools solution

Browse to the web site with your browser (I used Google Chrome).  
Then as hinted in the search text box, search for 'snickerdoodle'.  
You get a "I love snickerdoodle cookies!" message as response.  
Press F12 to open DevTools and go to the `Application` tab.  
Under `Storage` and then `Cookies` select the web site.  
Note that there is a cookie named `name` with the value of `0`.

Right-click on the value and `Edit "Value"`. Change the value to `1`.  
Reload the page by pressing `F5` and note that the message changes to "I love chocolate chip cookies!".  
Depending on the value of the cookie we get different messages.

Continue increasing the value of the cookie until you see the flag in the returned message.  
The correct value is `18`.
