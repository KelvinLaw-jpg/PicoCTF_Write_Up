## Solution

This challenge is to teach us what are [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie).
Another very useful links to cookies [MDN - Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
The important thing to understand here is `a small piece of data a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store cookies, create new cookies, modify existing ones, and send them back to the same server with later requests.`
So meaning the state or information of the website can be changed according to the information on the cookies, because it reads the input from the cookies.

### Solution

Go to the web site with your browser (I am using Google Chrome).    
Press F12 and go to the `Application` tab.  
Under `Storage` and then `Cookies` select the web site.  
Note that there is a cookie named `name` with the value of `-1`.
Now test the site by inputing 'snickerdoodle'and search.
You get a "I love snickerdoodle cookies!" message as response.
The cookie `name` with the value of `-1` just changed to `0`

Meaning if we change the `value` of `name`, it should display different infomation.

Double click the `0` and change it to 2. Refresh the page and you will see `I love oatmeal raisin cookies!`
Depending on the value of the cookie we get different messages.

Keep increasing the value of the cookie until you see the flag `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_88acab36}` in the returned message.  
The correct value is `18`.
