## Solution

To be honest, this is the first real challenge, first you are most likely like me and have no idea what is a bookmarklet so lets google it.

You will find links to [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/) (I skipped wiki since i want a more practical explanation)
, and also you will find a tutorial on how to make one @ [CaseyWatts page](https://gist.github.com/caseywatts/c0cec1f89ccdb8b469b1)

After reading these 2 page we know bookmarklets are just making the bookmarks like buttons to execute custom JavaScript functions.

Since the page says:
```
Welcome to my flag distribution website!
If you're reading this, your browser has succesfully received the flag.

Here's a bookmarklet for you to try:
```

```javascript
        javascript:(function() {
            var encryptedFlag = "àÒÆÞ¦È¬ëÙ£ÖÓÚåÛÑ¢ÕÓÒËÉ§©í";
            var key = "picoctf";
            var decryptedFlag = "";
            for (var i = 0; i < encryptedFlag.length; i++) {
                decryptedFlag += String.fromCharCode((encryptedFlag.charCodeAt(i) - key.charCodeAt(i % key.length) + 256) % 256);
            }
            alert(decryptedFlag);
        })();
    
```
So lets make a bookmark and edit the URL of the bookmark to the above script. After that, the flag showed itself by pressing the bookmark.
