## Solution

The goal of this exercise is to teach us what file inclusion is, therefore, the flag is located in different scripts of the website host(server)

As always, lets press F12 for inspector

Here is the HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <title>On Includes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  
    <h1>On Includes</h1>
    <p>Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive, 
       often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the 
       contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These 
       included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used
       to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code
       and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse
       of code.</p>

    <p> Source: Wikipedia on Include directive </p>
    <button type="button" onclick="greetings();">Say hello</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

There is no flag visible here, but there are two additional files to check out.

Lets see the style of this website 'style.css'
```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

There is the first part of the flag.

Lets check out the javascript

```javascript
function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_df589022}
```

There is the second part of the flag.
